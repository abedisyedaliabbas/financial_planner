# ✅ Environment Variable Updated - Now Redeploy!

## ✅ Good News

Your `REACT_APP_API_URL` is now correctly set to:
```
https://web-production-8b449.up.railway.app/api
```

Vercel says: **"A new deployment is needed for changes to take effect."**

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Redeploy Frontend

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)

1. Vercel should automatically trigger a new deployment
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. You should see a new deployment starting
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to complete

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy

If it doesn't auto-redeploy:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button (three dots menu)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

---

## ✅ Step 2: Verify Deployment

1. Wait for deployment to show **"Ready"** (green checkmark ✅)
2. The deployment should be successful

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Registration

1. Go to: https://financial-planner-blue-nine.vercel.app/register
2. Try registering with a **new email**:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: `test123@gmail.com` (or any new email)
   - Country: Singapore
   - Currency: SGD
   - Password: (at least 8 characters)
3. Click "Create Free Account"

**Expected**: Should work now! ✅

## 📋 Checklist

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

After redeploy, if registration still fails:

1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** (or use incognito mode)
3. Check browser console (F12) for any new errors
4. Try a different email address

**Wait for Vercel to redeploy (2-3 minutes), then try registering again! 🚀**
